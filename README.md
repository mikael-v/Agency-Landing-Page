## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I learned more about responsive design for different devices and while I am still not 100% confident with this, the time put in has helped build that confidence and improve the way I approach responsive styling.

I also learned how to make the interface appear different based on the device, by having mobile devices replace the navigation bar with a hamburger menu.



### Continued development

I would like to come back to this project at a later date and change some of the responsive stylign features so they are more flexible, for example on desktop zooming in/out of the page it effects some of the styling at the moment.

After improving this page, I'd like to have a go at using CSS grid, since I tend to rely more on flexbox. As well as perhaps using other technologies such as React or Vue.
